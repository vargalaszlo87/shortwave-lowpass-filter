# 🚀 shortwave-lowpass-filter

This repository is about Passive LPF filter with inverse Chebyshev LC Ladder.

## ⭐ First approach

**What makes a filter?** The filters are used to separate one band of frequency from another.

**How many types of filter are there?** There are four types:
- Low pass filter
- High pass filter
- Band pass filter
- Notch filter

👽**more precisely:** There are only two basic type: Low-pass filter and the High-pass filter. The other two types are a combination of a low-pass or high-pass filter. 

Check the types out:

**Is there another grouping aspect?** We can sort by active or passiv filters.

- **Passiv filter** This type has only passive parts: capacitance, inductance, resistance (or crystal, but the crystel work as a RLC circuit) therefore this type reduces the amplitude. 

- **Active filter** This type contains least one active compoment, such as a transistor.

🚷 **There are still many grouping aspect (analog/digital, time domain behaviour etc.)**, but we are talking about analog RF (Radio Frequency) or AF (Audio Frequency) filters. 

## ⭐ Second approach





How can we design an excellent filter easily? Choose the type of filter for your project and understand how it works. This description is about Low Pass Filter,
